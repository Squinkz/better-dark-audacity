# A Better Dark Mode for Audacity
Personally I'm not too fond of the dark mode skin that comes bundled with Audacity, so I made a better one.

### Installation
Place it in:
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\audacity\Theme
```
And make sure it's named ImageCache.png.

Then select the Custom theme in
```
Edit -> Preferences -> Interface
```
